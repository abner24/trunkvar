#TODO

1. For a combination of mutect and sequenza output there are a total of 16k lines.
2. The mutation rates are too high thus you have to choose the number of mutations that you think will affect tumor progressions
(eg. 5% or 50% of the segment file)
3. write a function to filter variants.
4. overlapping of single variants and segment remove variants from segment file (done)
